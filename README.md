- In its simplest way, WebRTC allows us to set up a live peer-to-peer direct connection b/w two browsers to exchange video, audio and data b/w them.

### Strategies for group calls
- Mesh - Multiple direct connections
- MCU - multipoint control units
- SFU - selective forwarding units

#### MESH architecture
